# Sentiment-and-Subjectivity-Analyzer
This project is a Python-based tool that analyzes the sentimentality and subjectivity of a given text. It can process text either from a URL or directly pasted by the user. The analysis uses the `TextBlob` and `newspaper` libraries to extract and process the text, and `nltk` for text tokenization.
